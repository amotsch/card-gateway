Node.js Round #1 for hotelquickly

1/ Install the project dependencies
npm install

2/ Bonus question
 - Let PayPal and Braintree manage this for you if possible
 - Use a service to manage it even if it costs money: http://www.authorize.net. This will not have to worry about security problems, attempts at fraud, hack your BDD
- encryption AES 256bits + BASE should be accessible only locally with a user / password secured and changed regularly
